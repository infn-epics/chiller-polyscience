Communications Commands — Commands must be entered in the exact format shown. Do not
send a [LF] (line feed) after the [CR] (character return). Be sure to follow character case exactly.
A response followed by an exclamation point (!) indicates that a command was executed correctly. A
question mark (?) indicates that the Controller could not execute the command (either because it
was in an improper format or the values were outside the allowable range). A response must be
received from the Controller before another command can be sent. All responses are terminated
with a single [CR].
